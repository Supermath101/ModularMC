# ModularMC
A MC Server software that will have features from the future. You get full control of all features all the way down to the physical MC mechanics themselves. The server is written in rust and made with love! Currently there is not much there, but progress is just ramping up!

# Plans
This project is meant to make every single aspect of the game toggleable. You want the beta terrain generator in 1.18? Sure. Want Netherite in 1.12? I suppose so. Want all the performance and modularity in one place without having to know how to code? Me too, and you can with ModularMC!
